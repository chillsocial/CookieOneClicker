## Some Questions and Answers
### What does Cookie One-Clicker do?
Cookie One-Clicker is a tool that does many things to make your gaming experience better, the most notable one giving you unlimited cookies. As I release new features, this will be included on the changelog in the [NPM Registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookieoneclicker).
### Is Cookie One-Clicker open-sourced?
Yes! You can download the source on any NPM-compatible console by running `npm i cookieoneclicker`. If you don't have NPM, you can [view this via JSDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/cookieoneclicker).
### How does Cookie One-Clicker remain undetected?
The entire game is coded in JavaScript, a client-side language (big flaw on the developer's end!). That means anything (and I mean **ANYTHING**) can be changed using JavaScript. This includes removing the `Cheated cookies taste awful` achievement.
### Does Cookie One-Clicker support the official Cookie Clicker dev tool?
Yes, but there's some limits...

To access the dev tool, just hover over the moldy cookie in the upper-left corner of your screen. Some features are intentionally sat by Cookie Clicker to trigger the `Game.RuinTheFun()` function. If you click `Ruin The Fun` or `All Achievements` (there might be others, this is just what I know) you will trigger this function.

This function (sadly) gets rid of all lumps, prestige levels and heavenly chips. It will also guilt you into not using the dev tool by making all the grannies look angry and spawn wrinklers constantly.

Don't worry--Cookie One-Clicker will automatically kill all these wrinklers automatically and you can revert this by clicking the `Wipe` option in the dev tool. Wiping the data will stop spawning wrinklers and return your lumps, prestige levels and heavenly chips. In a future update, as soon as a wrinkler is spawned it will wipe the data automatically.
